# Wifi-Jammer-and-Detector 📍
### A hacking mind can hack the hacker🎃.
nodemcu wifi jammer, WiFi Jammer is a gadget that is designed to disable wireless devices from hotpots. Why do you need it? You can imagine yourself as a friendly joke (a neighbor, of course, will be delighted when you cut off his Netflix or for example, a football match at the most interesting place) or a criminal application: an attacker can disconnect security cameras or other important equipment from the network. In this article we will discuss what are the inexpensive options for hardware deauthenticators, how to use them and how to protect against such attacks.

### How does this “nodemcu wifi jammer” work🤔
Unlike real jammers, which interrupt the signal of a radio transmitter with its stronger signal, the deauthenticator works at the program level. It implements a denial of service attack by sending a deauthentication frame to the router on behalf of devices connected to the network. Since this frame is not encrypted in any way, it is enough for a stub to find out the MAC addresses of the devices through the network traffic.

Deauthentication is usually part of a complex attack on a network. It is used to create an “evil twin” of the access point or to intercept a handshake, which then allows you to decrypt the password. However, jamming can be useful in and of itself.

All tips reviewed are highly recommended for educational use only. Blocking the transfer of data and the use of the considered funds may be prosecuted. To carry out penetration tests, you must obtain the appropriate written confirmation of the customer. Remember that the deauthorization data is stored in the logs of the router..
